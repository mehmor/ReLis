# ReLiS

*ReLiS is a tool for conducting systematic reviews.*

Systematic review is a technique used to search for evidence in scientific literature that is conducted in a formal manner, following a well-defined process, according to a previously elaborated protocol. Conducting a systematic reviews involves many steps over a long period of time, and is often laborious and repetitive. This is why we have created ReLiS which provides essential software support to reviewers in conducting high quality systematic reviews. With ReLiS, you can plan, conduct, and report your review. 

Unlike other systematic review tools, ReLiS is an online tool that automatically installs and configures your projects. You conduct reviews collaboratively and iteratively on the cloud. ReLiS is engineered following a model-driven development approach. It features a domain-specific modeling editor and an architecture that enables on-the-fly installation and (re)configuration of multiple concurrently running projects.

You can use a publically available instance of ReLiS at [http://relis.iro.umontreal.ca/](http://relis.iro.umontreal.ca/). This GitHub repository allows you to install ReLiS on your servers.
